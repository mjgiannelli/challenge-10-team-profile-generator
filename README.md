  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)

  My project is a team profile generator. It allows a manager to organize their team, as well as, have their email and other information readily available to the manager

  I created this project for managers that need help organizing their team and have a one stop shop place to pull any information they would like about their employee whenever they would need to.

  A manager will answer prompts regarding their information to generate their employee card. The manager is then presented a menu to add an engineer, an intern or finish building their team. If they select 'add an engineer' or 'add an intern' the manager will be prompted questions regarding the employee to use to generate their employee card. After answering these questions, the manager is then brought back to that same menu. The manager will add as many engineers and interns are on their team. Once they are finished, when they are presented with the menu again they will select 'finish building my team'. That will then cause the program to take the information enetered by the manager and create a webpage displaying their team's employee cards. The manager now has access to the employee's emails or other information whenever they choose.
